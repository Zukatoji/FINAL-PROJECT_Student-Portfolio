# FINAL-PROJECT_Student-Portfolio

This repository contains a compilation of laboratory activities, midterm exam, and final laboratory exam completed during my Internet of Things (IoT) subject. The projects show my learning progress from basic Arduino programming to more advanced Arduino–Python integration and API-based control.

This portfolio reflects not only the final outputs, but also the learning journey throughout the course.
